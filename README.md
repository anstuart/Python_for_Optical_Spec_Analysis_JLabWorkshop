# Python_for_Optical_Spec_Analysis_JLabWorkshop
An introduction to using Python for optical spectroscopy data analysis (e.g.  absorption and emission spectroscopy), using Jupyter notebooks.

This repository contains some sample time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption data, and a Jupyterlab notebook which walks you through some ways to analyse the data with Python.

To use this you will need an installation of Python (around 3.6, but version shouldn't really matter), and jupyter notebook (I recommmed using jupyterlab to run!)
You will also need numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and ipympl packages.

Note that I'm really not an expert in Python or coding! This tutorial shows you ways of doing things that work, but they're not necessarily the most efficient!
